### About

I started Ultima my last project in 2022 because I one of my favorite aspects of video games is the iconic things that various characters say. So, I wanted to find an API to contribute to with some of my favorite quotes, and as far as I could tell, there weren't any. Hence, Ultima.rest was created.  

### Support

Consider showing some support if you use the api in your projects.

#### Adding New Quotes

- The quote schema is as follows:

```
quote: 'string' // The quote. We suggest no more than two sentences.
character: 'string', // Character name as it appears in game
title: 'string', // Game title without special symbols e.g. Crisis Final Fantasy VII
esrb: 'string', // E, E10, T, M, A, or RP
release: 'number'  // Year of Release
```

- Copy the data [template](./data/template.json) to paste into the [quotes.json](./data/quotes.json) making as many copies as needed.
- Once you've added your quotes and before you submit a push request make sure the template is not altered.
- After your additions are reviewed a member of the team will add your profile to the [Ultima.rest](https://ultima.rest) website.
