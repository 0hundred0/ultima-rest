### About

I started Ultima as my last project in 2022 because one of my favorite aspects of video games are the iconic things that the characters say. So, I wanted to contribute to an API with some of my favorite quotes, and as far as I could tell, there weren't any. Hence, Ultima was created.

<br/>

### Support

Consider showing some support if you use the api in your projects.
